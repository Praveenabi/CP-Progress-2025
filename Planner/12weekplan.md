# 12-Week Plan: Codeforces Candidate Master & MAANG Interview Preparation

**For the period ending [03-03-2025 - 03-06-2025], I will:**
- Increase my Codeforces rating from 695 to 1900 (Candidate Master).
- Be fully prepared for MAANG interviews by mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and problem-solving skills.

---

## Overview
- **Current Skill Level**: No prior DSA knowledge, but basic programming skills.
- **Time Commitment**: 3 hours/day (split between theory and practice).
- **Platforms**: Codeforces, AtCoder, LeetCode.
- **Execution System**: Weekly goals, daily tasks, and progress tracking via GitHub.
- **Learning Approach**: Build foundational skills progressively, practice deliberately, and integrate competitive programming with interview preparation.

## Week-by-Week Breakdown

### Weeks 1–2: Foundations
- **Focus**: Basic data structures (Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues).
- **Daily Schedule**:
  - **1.5 hours**: Study theory using GeeksforGeeks and freeCodeCamp (e.g., array operations, string manipulation, linked list traversal).
  - **1.5 hours**: Solve 3–5 easy problems/day on LeetCode ("Array" and "String" tags) and AtCoder Beginner Contests (problems A and B).
- **Weekly Goal**:
  - Understand and implement basic data structures.
  - Solve 20 easy problems (10 LeetCode, 10 AtCoder).
- **Tactics**:
  - Spend 15 minutes thinking per problem; check editorials if stuck after 15 minutes.
  - Use paper/whiteboard to visualize solutions (e.g., array manipulations, stack operations).

### Weeks 3–4: Intermediate DSA
- **Focus**: Sorting, Searching, Recursion.
- **Daily Schedule**:
  - **1 hour**: Study theory (e.g., quicksort, binary search, recursive problem-solving).
  - **2 hours**: Solve 3–4 medium problems/day on LeetCode ("Two Pointers," "Sorting") and AtCoder Beginner Contests (problem C). Participate in 1 Codeforces Div. 3 contest/week.
- **Weekly Goal**:
  - Master sorting, searching, and recursion.
  - Solve 15 medium problems and participate in 2 contests.
- **Tactics**:
  - Aim to solve AtCoder problem C in 30 minutes initially, reducing to 10 minutes by Week 4.
  - Review solutions from high-rated coders post-contest to learn optimization techniques.

### Weeks 5–6: Advanced Data Structures
- **Focus**: Trees, Hash Tables, Graphs (BFS, DFS basics).
- **Daily Schedule**:
  - **1 hour**: Study theory (e.g., binary tree traversal, hash table implementation, graph representations).
  - **2 hours**: Solve 2–3 problems/day on LeetCode ("Tree," "Hash Map") and Codeforces Div. 2 (problems A–B).
- **Weekly Goal**:
  - Implement trees, hash tables, and basic graph algorithms.
  - Solve 10 problems/week.
- **Tactics**:
  - Use AtCoder Problems to track solved problems and identify weaknesses.
  - Solve problems in 10–15 minutes to build speed and accuracy.

### Weeks 7–8: Algorithmic Techniques
- **Focus**: Dynamic Programming (DP), Greedy, Binary Search.
- **Daily Schedule**:
  - **1 hour**: Study theory (e.g., DP basics, greedy choice properties, binary search applications).
  - **2 hours**: Solve 2–3 DP-tagged problems/day on Codeforces (R1200–R1400) and LeetCode ("Dynamic Programming" tag). Join 1 AtCoder Regular Contest/week.
- **Weekly Goal**:
  - Grasp DP, Greedy, and Binary Search concepts.
  - Solve 10 problems/week and participate in 2 contests.
- **Tactics**:
  - Focus on 50 DP problems rated R1200–R1400 across these weeks.
  - Practice virtual contests on Codeforces to simulate real-time problem-solving.

### Weeks 9–10: MAANG Interview Prep
- **Focus**: Apply DSA to MAANG-specific problems.
- **Daily Schedule**:
  - **0.5 hours**: Review DSA concepts (quick recap of arrays, trees, DP, etc.).
  - **2.5 hours**: Solve 3–4 MAANG-style problems/day on LeetCode ("Top Interview Questions," company filters for MAANG). Conduct 1 mock interview/week.
- **Weekly Goal**:
  - Solve 20 MAANG-style problems.
  - Complete 2–3 mock interviews.
- **Tactics**:
  - Use LeetCode’s company filters to target MAANG problems.
  - Simulate interviews with peers or platforms like Pramp to practice explaining solutions.

### Weeks 11–12: Consolidation and Review
- **Focus**: Intensify practice and review all concepts.
- **Daily Schedule**:
  - **0.5 hours**: Review all DSA concepts (e.g., revisit weak areas like DP or graphs).
  - **2.5 hours**: Solve 3–4 problems/day (mix from Codeforces Div. 2 C–D, AtCoder D, LeetCode Hard). Join 1–2 contests/week.
- **Weekly Goal**:
  - Solve 15 problems/week.
  - Participate in 2–3 contests.
- **Tactics**:
  - Aim to solve R1400 problems in 10 minutes.
  - Apply to MAANG jobs in Week 11 to align with interview preparation.
